        Starting out in coding, I once believed that JavaScript was a smaller
        version of Java â€“ a misconception that makes me chuckle now. Back then,
        I didn&apos;t know the first thing about coding, but I decided to teach
        myself. Self-learning was no walk in the park, but it instilled in me
        the drive to learn and improve. I used to think I could be a perfect
        coder, but I soon realized that technology moves too quickly to keep up
        with everything. Embracing the idea that learning is a lifelong journey,
        I&apos;ve discovered that consistency is crucial. Facing bugs and
        issues, although initially overwhelming, became stepping stones to
        progress. Now, my interest lies in Next.js, a frontend framework that
        aligns perfectly with my passion for staying on top of the latest in
        technology. My coding journey is a testament to the idea that growth
        comes from challenges, adaptability, and a continuous pursuit of
        knowledge.
